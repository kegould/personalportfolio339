        <h2>KG Site Designs</h2>
        <p>This past summer, during quarantine, I launched my own start-up KG Site Designs, working to design and create fully functional, user-centered websites for small businesses from the ground up. This experience taught me to incorporate what customers want while maintaining accessibility, consistency, and efficiency in design. Starting KG Site Designs gave me the opportunity to understand UX concepts firsthand and get a first-hand look at the reality of starting a small business.</p>

        <h2>Michigan FinTech</h2>
        <p>As VP of Digital Marketing for Michigan FinTech, the University’s largest financial technology club, I worked to increase membership through producing online content using UX practices and design. Check out our <a href="https://www.instagram.com/michiganfintech/">Instagram</a> or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/michiganfintech">LinkedIn</a> for more information on upcoming events. Beyond working on the executive board of the organization, MFT has taught me so much about the financial technology industry and has truly become a passion of mine.

        <h2>F the 15</h2>
        <p>After initially being recruited as a student ambassador for social media brand F the Freshman 15, I ultimately came into the role of a graphic designer for their Instagram account and website. This transition combined my love of digital marketing and promoting a healthy lifestyle. Having been a fan of the account, which posts about nutrition in college with over 10k followers, I now find myself so excited at all F the Freshman 15 has to offer its audience and am so thankful for my position with them.

        <h2>Rise Up</h2>
        <p>This Fall, I acquired a position within the University of Michigan’s School of Information, working as an Undergraduate Research Assistant for Dr. Barbara Ericson’s Rise Up for Computer Science Principles program. The program helps high school students from underrepresented groups prepare for their AP Computer Science Principles exam. Beyond my role as a help session facilitator, I was responsible for keeping track of each student’s data, progress, and success on their online textbook to help the associated research study analyze the success of the program. I presented on topics such as UX, Cybersecurity, and Data Science, and collaborated with peers to ensure our sessions were demonstrating positive trends across our data collections.</p>
